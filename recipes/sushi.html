    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish known for its combination of vinegared rice, seafood, and vegetables. It typically features bite-sized pieces of rice topped with raw or cooked fish, seafood like shrimp or crab, and sometimes wrapped in seaweed (nori). Sushi is often served with soy sauce, wasabi (Japanese horseradish), and pickled ginger, offering a balance of flavors and textures that highlight the freshness and quality of its ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Sushi Rice (Shari)</li>
        <li>Nori (Seaweed Sheets)</li>
        <li>Sashimi-Grade Fish and Seafood</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Sushi Rice (Shari): </strong>Cook short-grain Japanese rice and season it with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt to achieve a sticky consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Nori (Seaweed Sheets): </strong>Cut nori into appropriate sizes for rolling sushi and ensure it is dry and crisp.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Sashimi-Grade Fish and Seafood: </strong>Slice raw fish and seafood into thin, bite-sized pieces suitable for sushi.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Vegetables and Fillings: </strong>Slice vegetables like cucumber and avocado into thin strips and prepare cooked fillings such as crab sticks or shrimp.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble Sushi Rolls (Maki): </strong>Lay out a sheet of nori, spread sushi rice evenly over it, add fillings along one edge, then roll tightly using a bamboo mat (makisu).</li>
        <li><strong>Slice Sushi Rolls: </strong>Use a sharp knife to slice sushi rolls into bite-sized pieces, ensuring clean cuts without crushing the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Nigiri Sushi: </strong>Form small mounds of sushi rice by hand, press a slice of fish or seafood on top, and shape gently into a compact, bite-sized piece.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve with Condiments: </strong>Arrange sushi pieces on a platter, serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger for dipping and flavor enhancement.</li>
